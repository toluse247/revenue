The first aim of this project is to generate a comprehensive record of Customer billing details, payment records and marketing team alignment by bringing together 3 separate datasets.

This consolidated file was then analyzed to paint a picture of the revenue performance of different product segments against set targets.

Further analysis was done to tell a story of individual staff performance as well as sales teams performance.
